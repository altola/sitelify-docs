Sitelify makes delivering high performance Sitecore sites easy. It eliminates the need for your Sitecore content delivery server to be responsible for page generation and delivery at runtime. Instead, your Sitecore server can focus on making relevant, personalized content available when it is needed.

The majority - if not the entirety - of your website is delivered by Netlify, a global CDN. Not only does this improve page load speed by bringing your website closer to your visitors, but it also improves performance by reducing the load on your Sitecore server.

For more information on Sitelify, see the [Product Overview](product-overview.md) section.

Or jump right into Sitelify by [installing it on your Sitecore server](install.md).
